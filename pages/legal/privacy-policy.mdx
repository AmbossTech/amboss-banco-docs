# MIBANCO PRIVACY POLICY

This privacy policy (“**Policy**”) explains how Amboss Technologies, Inc. and our affiliates (collectively, “**Amboss**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”) collects, stores, uses, and discloses personal data about you and how you can make requests or submit inquiries to us about your personal data.

**Please read this Policy carefully**. If you do not agree with this Policy or any part thereof, you should not
access or use any part of the MiBanco Services. If you change your mind in the
future, you must stop using the MiBanco Services.

## WHAT DOES THIS POLICY COVER

This Policy applies to personal data we collect through our website located at [https://mibanco.app/](https://mibanco.app/) and successor sites (collectively the “**MiBanco Sites**”) in connection with digital wallet and messaging services that we provide you (and together with the MiBanco Sites, the “**MiBanco Services**”). This Policy does not apply to any products, services, websites, or content that are offered by third parties or have their own privacy policy.

In this Policy, “personal data” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with or reasonably can be used to identify an individual or household and other data that is linked to personal data or is otherwise defined as “personal data,” “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information” by applicable laws.

In general, we collect personal data in encrypted form as the MiBanco Services are designed to encrypt data directly on your device e.g., on the client side. Therefore, we only receive the limited personal data that is sent from your device to our servers. This protects against us and third parties from being able to read your personal data. However, many jurisdictions still consider encrypted data as personal data protected under applicable laws. We may need to collect, use and share your personal data (even in encrypted form) in certain circumstances, which we explain in detail in this Policy.

## HOW IS THIS POLICY UPDATED

We may modify this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Policy on our MiBanco Sites and use reasonable efforts to provide you additional notification by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review this Policy each time you visit our MiBanco Sites to stay informed of our privacy practices and the choices available to you.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The personal data we collect about you depends on how you interact with us or use the MiBanco Services. However, we take your privacy seriously and adopt data minimization principles to collect the least amount of personal data that we can in order to provide you with the MiBanco Services and fulfill our legal and contractual obligations.
