9.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION.

    9.1. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Binding Arbitration</span>. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “**Disputes**”) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property rights, You and Amboss agree (a) to waive Your and Amboss’ respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the MiBanco Services resolved in a court, and (b) to waive Your and Amboss’ respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, You and Amboss agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more Persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

    9.2. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</span>. You and Amboss agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the MiBanco Services is personal to You and Amboss and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

    9.3. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Federal Arbitration Act</span>. You and Amboss agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 9 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “**FAA**”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws.

    9.4. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</span>. You and Amboss agree that each party will use good faith efforts to notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Amboss shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Amboss Technologies, Inc., Attn: Chief Executive Officer, 1910 21st Ave S, Nashville, TN 37212, United States. If You and Amboss cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either You or Amboss may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 9, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 9.1, file a claim in court.

    9.5. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Process</span>. EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO DISPUTES IN WHICH EITHER PARTY SEEKS TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR SEEKS INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR THE ALLEGED UNLAWFUL USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, YOU AGREE THAT YOU MUST COMMENCE OR FILE ANY DISPUTE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DATE THE DISPUTE AROSE, OTHERWISE THE UNDERLYING CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED (WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT SUCH CLAIM REGARDING THE DISPUTE). You and Amboss agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in Delaware, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“**JAMS**”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States respectively, sitting in Delaware, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of Your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.

    9.6. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Authority of Arbitrator</span>. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

    9.7. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Rules of JAMS</span>. The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, You either (a) acknowledge and agree that You have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive Your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

    9.8. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Severability</span>. If any term, clause or provision of this Section 9 is held invalid or unenforceable, all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 9 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 9.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable laws.

    9.9. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Opt-Out Right</span>. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty days of the date You first accepted the terms of this Section 9 by writing to: Amboss Technologies, Inc., Attn: Chief Executive Officer, 1910 21st Ave S, Nashville, TN 37212, United States. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include Your full name and clearly indicate Your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, You are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 10.

    9.10. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Attorneys’ Fees and Costs</span>. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If You or Amboss need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

10. MISCELLANEOUS

    10.1. <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Governing Law</span>. You agree that the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any Dispute, except to the extent governed by federal law.
